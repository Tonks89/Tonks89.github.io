##  ARACHNIS: A GUI to design and analyze cable-driven robots

### Description

ARACHNIS is a graphical user interface for the analysis and parametric design of Cable Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs). ARACHNIS takes as inputs the design parameters of the robot, the task specifications, and returns a visualisation of a set of workspaces to assess the designs (the  Wrench Feasible Workspace (WFW) and Interference-Free Constant Orientation Workspace (IFCOW)). The WFW is traced from the capacity margin, a measure of the robustness of the equilibrium of the robot. Interferences between the moving parts of a CDPR are  determined by an existing technique for tracing the interference-free workspace of such robots.

## Toolbox for the simulation of the kinematics and sensors of mobile robots  

### Description

Authors: Ana Lucia Cruz & Ekaterina Peshkova  
A toolbox in MATLAB/Simulink, containing:  
1) A library of kinematic models and sensors (exteroceptive and proprioceptive)    
2) A graphical user interface that allows users to build ready-to-use simulink models containing the different components in the library with personalized parameters.  
The toolbox has been tested on control and  localization simulations (for example: odometry, sequential localization).

# Projects

##  A 3 DOF PPR parallel robot

This project consisted in designing a parallel robot for assembly operations with a mobility of two translations and one rotation. Such mechanism can also be referred to as a cylindrical parallel mechanism, and is usually employed in machining operations. To comply with the desired assembly task and motion patter, the mechanism was designed according to the following priorities:

Priority 1: Be capable of moving throughout a circular regular positional workspace 
RPW of diameter 500 mm;  
Priority 2: The moving platform should have a rotation range equal to ±30_ for any 
position of its geometric center within the RPW;   
Priority 3: The mechanim should be light;  
Priority 4: The legs of the mechanism should be identical, namely, the mechanism 
should be symmetrical;  
Priority 5: The point-displacement of the geometriccenter of the moving-platform 
should be smaller than 1 mm for a payload equal to 500 N (the payload is supposed to 
be normal to the moving platform);  
Priority 6: The rotational error of the moving platform should be smaller than 1 deg for 
a moment equal to 100 N.m about the axis passing through the geometric center of the 
moving platform and normal to the latter.

# Manuals


## EMG electrode placement and test manual  

Are you engineer with little or no experience on EMG or motion capture sensors? Then, this manual is for you. 
The manual guides you through the process of finding bony landmarks, using these landmarks as references for sensor placement, and finally, testing the good placement of the sensors through a series of excercises.
I designed this manual for my own experiments which involved the human right arm and back, however you could use it as reference to build your own protocol for other body sections ;).

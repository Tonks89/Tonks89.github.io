##  ARACHNIS: A GUI to design and analyze cable-driven robots

### Description

ARACHNIS is a graphical user interface for the analysis and parametric design of Cable Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs). ARACHNIS takes as inputs the design parameters of the robot, the task specifications, and returns a visualisation of a set of workspaces to assess the designs (the  Wrench Feasible Workspace (WFW) and Interference-Free Constant Orientation Workspace (IFCOW)). The WFW is traced from the capacity margin, a measure of the robustness of the equilibrium of the robot. Interferences between the moving parts of a CDPR are  determined by an existing technique for tracing the interference-free workspace of such robots.

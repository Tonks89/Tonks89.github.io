# ROBOTICS

##  ARACHNIS: A GUI to design and analyze cable-driven robots 

ARACHNIS is a graphical user interface for the analysis and parametric design of Cable Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs). This interface takes as inputs the design parameters of the robot, the task specifications, and returns a visualisation of a set of workspaces to assess the designs. These workspaces are the  Wrench Feasible Workspace (WFW) and the Interference-Free Constant Orientation Workspace (IFCOW). The WFW is traced from the capacity margin, a measure of the robustness of the equilibrium of the robot. On the other hand, the IFCOW is traced via an existing technique for determining the interferences between the moving parts of CDPRs.

## Toolbox for the simulation of the kinematics and sensors of mobile robots 

Authors: Ana Lucia Cruz & Ekaterina Peshkova  
A toolbox in MATLAB/Simulink, containing:  
1) A library of kinematic models and sensors (exteroceptive and proprioceptive).    
2) A graphical user interface that allows users to build ready-to-use simulink models containing the different components in the library with personalized parameters.  
The toolbox has been tested on control and localization simulations (for example: odometry, sequential localization).

##  A 3 DOF PPR parallel robot

This project consisted in designing a parallel robot for assembly operations. To perform this task, the desired mobility of the robot was two translations and one rotation. Such mechanisms are commonly known as cylindrical parallel mechanisms and they are usually employed in machining operations. To comply with the desired assembly task and motion pattern, the mechanism was designed according to the following priorities:

Priority 1: Be capable of moving throughout a circular regular positional workspace 
RPW of diameter 500 mm;  
Priority 2: The moving platform should have a rotation range equal to ±30 degrees for any 
position of its geometric center within the RPW;   
Priority 3: The mechanim should be light;  
Priority 4: The legs of the mechanism should be identical, namely, the mechanism 
should be symmetrical;  
Priority 5: The point-displacement of the geometric center of the moving-platform 
should be smaller than 1 mm for a payload equal to 500 N (the payload is supposed to 
be normal to the moving platform);  
Priority 6: The rotational error of the moving platform should be smaller than 1 degree for 
a moment equal to 100 N.m about the axis passing through the geometric center of the 
moving platform and normal to the latter.

## EMG electrode placement and test manual  

Are you an engineer with little or no experience on EMG or motion capture sensors? Then, this manual is for you. 
The manual guides you through the process of finding bony landmarks, using these landmarks as references for sensor placement, and finally, testing the good placement of the sensors through a series of excercises.
I designed this manual for my own experiments which involved the human right arm and back, however you could use it as reference to build your own protocol for other body sections.

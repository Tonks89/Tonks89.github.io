##  ARACHNIS: A GUI to design and analyze cable-driven robots

### Description

ARACHNIS is a graphical user interface for the analysis and parametric design of Cable Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs). ARACHNIS takes as inputs the design parameters of the robot, the task specifications, and returns a visualisation of a set of workspaces to assess the designs (the  Wrench Feasible Workspace (WFW) and Interference-Free Constant Orientation Workspace (IFCOW)). The WFW is traced from the capacity margin, a measure of the robustness of the equilibrium of the robot. Interferences between the moving parts of a CDPR are  determined by an existing technique for tracing the interference-free workspace of such robots.

# Projects

##  A 3 DOF PPR parallel robot

This project consisted in designing a parallel robot for assembly operations with a mobility of two translations and one rotation. Such mechanism can also be referred to as a cylindrical parallel mechanism, and is usually employed in machining operations. To comply with the desired assembly task and motion patter, the mechanism was designed according to the following priorities:

Priority 1: Be capable of moving throughout a circular regular positional workspace 
RPW of diameter 500 mm; 
Priority 2: The moving platform should have a rotation range equal to ±30_ for any 
position of its geometric center within the RPW; 
Priority 3: The mechanism should be light; 
Priority 4: The legs of the mechanism should be identical, namely, the mechanism 
should be symmetrical; 
Priority 5: The point-displacement of the geometriccenter of the moving-platform 
should be smaller than 1 mm for a payload equal to 500 N (the payload is supposed to 
be normal to the moving platform); 
Priority 6: The rotational error of the moving platform should be smaller than 1 deg for 
a moment equal to 100 N.m about the axis passing through the geometric center of the 
moving platform and normal to the latter.

#  ARACHNIS: Interface to design cable robot

## Description

ARACHNIS is a graphical user interface for the analysis and paramet ric design of Cable Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs). ARACHNIS takes as inputs the design param eters of the robot, the task specifications, and returns a visualisation of the CDPR Wrench Feasible
Workspace (WFW) and Interference-Free Constant Orientation Workspace (IFCOW). The WFW is traced from the capacity margin, a measure of the robustness of the equilibrium of the robot. Interferences between the moving parts of a CDPR are also determined by an existing technique for tracing the interference-free workspace of such robots. Finally, the WFW and the IFCOW of a planar cable-driven parallel robot and of a spatial cable-driven parallel robot are plotted in order to demonstrate the potential of ARACHNIS.

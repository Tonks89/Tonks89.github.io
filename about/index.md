Hola! My name is Ana Lucia, I am robotics engineer and enthusiast of the popularisation of science and technology among children and women.

I come from a small but lovely country called Honduras. A land of coffee, mayas, jungles, beaches, first-class reefs, corn-based delicacies, and wonderful people (or catrachos). 
Since 2011 I have been living in France building my dream career in robotics. I began by studying a master's degree in advanced robotics at the Ã‰cole centrale de Nantes, a place where I did not only learn about jacobians and kinematic models, but also the art of improving our environment through robots.
Currently, I'm a PhD student at INRIA, where I am part of the MimeTIC team and the ANR project ENTRACTE.

You can donwload my [CV](/share/Cruz_CV.pdf) (french version) here. English version coming soon!

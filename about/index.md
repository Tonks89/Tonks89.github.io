Hola! My name is Ana Lucia, I am a robotics and biosignal processing engineer interested in the use of technology to improve our daily living and transcend motor disabilities.

I come from a small but lovely country called Honduras. A land of coffee, mayas, jungles, beaches, first-class reefs, corn-based delicacies, and wonderful people (or catrachos). 
Since 2011 I have been living in France following my passion for robotics. I began by studying a master's degree in [advanced robotics](http://masteraria.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr/index.php/presentation-roba-en) at the Ã‰cole centrale de Nantes, a place where I did not only learn about jacobians and kinematic models, but also the art of solving problems through robots.
Afterwards, I did a Ph.D. at [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/rennes) (MimeTIC team, [ANR project ENTRACTE](http://homepages.laas.fr/nmansard/entracte/index.php?n=Main.HomePage)), where I worked on analyzing human motion (at a kinematic and muscular level) to control artificial limbs (virtual characters).

Currently, I am looking for an opportunity to merge my experience in robotics, biosignal processing, machine learning, and in designing and conducting experiments, for medical, assistive, and/or rehabilitation applications.

Hola! My name is Ana Lucia, I am a robotics engineer interested in the development of smart motion control solutions and the popularization of science and technology.

I come from a small but lovely country called Honduras. A land of coffee, mayas, jungles, beaches, first-class reefs, corn-based delicacies, and wonderful people (or catrachos). 
Since 2011, I have been living in France following my passion for robotics. I began by studying a master's degree in [advanced robotics](http://masteraria.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr/index.php/presentation-roba-en) at the Ã‰cole centrale de Nantes, a place where I did not only learn about jacobians and kinematic models, but also the art of solving problems through robots.
Afterwards, I did a Ph.D. at [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/rennes) ([ANR project ENTRACTE](http://homepages.laas.fr/nmansard/entracte/index.php?n=Main.HomePage)), where I worked on designing motion controllers via machine learning techniques.

During my free time, I like writing about anything in science I find interesting, reading science fiction and fantasy stories, and playing piano :)

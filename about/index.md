Hola! My name is Ana Lucia, I am robotics engineer and enthusiast of the popularisation of science and technology among children and women.

I come from a small but lovely country called Honduras. A land of coffee, mayas, jungles, beaches, first-class reefs, corn-based delicacies, and wonderful people (or catrachos). 
Since 2011 I have been living in France building my dream career in robotics. I began by studying a master's degree in [advanced robotics](http://masteraria.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr/index.php/presentation-roba-en) at the École centrale de Nantes, a place where I did not only learn about jacobians and kinematic models, but also the art of improving our environment through robots.
Currently, I'm a PhD student at [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/rennes), where I am part of the MimeTIC team and the [ANR project ENTRACTE](http://homepages.laas.fr/nmansard/entracte/index.php?n=Main.HomePage).

You can download my CV (french version) [here](/share/Cruz_CV.pdf). English version coming soon!

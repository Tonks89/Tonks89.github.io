Hola! Salut! Hello! Ciao! my name is Ana Lucia, I am a Robotics engineer and Science communicator.

I come from a small but lovely country called Honduras. A land of coffee, mayas, jungles, beaches, first-class reefs, corn-based delicacies, and wonderful people (or catrachos). 
In 2011, I moved to France to follow my passion for robotics. I began by studying a master's degree in [advanced robotics](http://masteraria.irccyn.ec-nantes.fr/index.php/presentation-roba-en) at the École centrale de Nantes. There, I learned about jacobians, kinematic models, and the art of solving problems through robots.
Afterwards, I did a Ph.D. at [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/rennes) ([ANR project ENTRACTE](http://homepages.laas.fr/nmansard/entracte/index.php?n=Main.HomePage)), where I worked on understanding how humans control their motions in order to simplify the way we control avatars and robots. Currently, I am also working on STEM advocacy initiatives and making scientific content accessible to everyone, everywhere. For this purpose, I design workshops, teach, and also organize fundraisers to provide children in Honduras with computers. The access to a basic education is a privilege in most places in the world, I believe in democratizing STEM education for a global, sustainable future.

During my free time, I also enjoy writing about anything in science I find interesting, getting immersed in Asimov's or Tolkien's stories, and playing piano.

Feel free to explore the site for more info. Here you can download my [CV](/share/AnaLuciaCruz_CV.pdf).

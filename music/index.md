An important part of my life is music. I began playing piano when I was 7 years old at the Ars Nova Conservatory lead by Asha Santwan in Honduras. Currently, I am self-taught and I play classical and pop/rock music.
My ultimate favorite composer is F. Chopin, however I am also inlove with Chris Martin's (Coldplay) dreamy melodies and Matt Bellamy's (Muse) mystical piano solos. Here you will find some music samples and a piece of my musical adventures.
